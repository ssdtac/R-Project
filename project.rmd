```{r}
library("ISLR") 
library("tidyverse") 
library("ggplot")
```


First, read the dataset and clean it
```{r}
# this will have problems
d = read_delim("./../title_basics.tsv")

# so we drop incomplete rows to make it not
d = drop_na(d, genres)
```
```{r echo=False}
# this should not have problems
ratings = read_tsv("./../title_ratings.tsv")
```

here for testing purposes
```{r}
problems(ratings)
```

Merging Data
```{r}
data = inner_join(d, ratings, by = "tconst")
data = inner_join(data, crew, by = "tconst")
```

Start on descriptive data analysis
```{r}
# histogram of ratings
ggplot(ratings, aes(x=averageRating)) + geom_histogram(fill="white", color="black")

```
Include "questions" we asked
